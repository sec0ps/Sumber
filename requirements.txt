# Purpose: This script is part of the Sumber Security Source Code Analyzer, which provides
#          enterprise-grade static application security testing (SAST) capabilities for
#          identifying OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in source code. The tool performs
#          comprehensive security analysis using AST parsing and pattern matching to detect
#          injection flaws, authentication issues, cryptographic failures, and other
#          security vulnerabilities with detailed remediation guidance.
